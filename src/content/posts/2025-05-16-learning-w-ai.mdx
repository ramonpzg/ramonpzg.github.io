# Leveling Up with AI

I wasn't one of the first ones to use ChatGPT, Claude or any of the open-source large language
models we all use, love, or love hating on, but I do enjoy buying intelligence for `<$20` as much as
the next person. This journal entry is a letter to my future self in the hopes I humour him with details
on how he used the equivalent of AI candles in 2025 when everyone else in his present is past the
AI light bulb or flying cars.

The next few sections cover tools, workflows, modalities and prompting techniques I have been taking
advantage of in the last year to learn about history, programming languages, robotics, application
development, and more. I won't try to organise these sections in some logical way, but I will try to make
them funny and interesting.

## Deep Podcasteur

Deep Research combined with a decent speech-to-text model has allowed me to enjoy a bespoke HardCore
History podcast that is a sarcastic delight to listen to after 20-30 minutes perusing the internet.

I started building these podcasts by painstakenly crafting a prompt that would give me every little
detail that interests me about a country. In it, I would try to control for information required, depth,
tone, words not allowed (this rarely works in practice), and style. I would then run this prompt through
the DR agents from OpenAI, Gemini, Qwen, and (rarely) perplexity. From there, I'd quickly skim through
the output of each looking for inconsistencies, for example, since my goal is to listen to these, I would
specifically ask for no tables, code blocks, or images and these can break the flow of the model narrating
the story
