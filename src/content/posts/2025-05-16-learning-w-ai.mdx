# Leveling Up with AI

I wasn't one of the first ones to use ChatGPT, Claude or any of the open-source large language
models we all use, love, or love hating on as my foray into Generative AI started with MusicGen
and AudioGen, but I'm certainly taking as much advantage as possible from any form of intelligence
available to me for `<$20`. This guide is a letter to my future self delivering some dry humour
on how I used the equivalent of AI candles in 2025 when, the me in 2030 or beyond, will be
using AI light bulbs.
